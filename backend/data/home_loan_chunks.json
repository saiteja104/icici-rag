ICICI  Bank's vision, ‘Fair to Customers, Fair to Bank’ is very true and can be seen in practice. The commitment and sincerity shown by  ICICI  Bank employees is really appreciated.Laxmi MalipatilThanks to my Relationship Manager for all the help in getting my loan disbursed. I still remember the day when I told him about the property in Mysore and I was little sceptical whether the loan would be processed or not. His approach to the case and knowledge is what impressed me. His prompt responses to all my messages, questions, and guidance in making me understand the calculations were very helpful.People like him are an asset to the organisation. All the best!!!Suraj KrishnadasThanks to my  RM  for helping me on my Mortgage Loan with the paperwork and closing it. I really liked her positive attitude and commitment to work",

ICICI  Bank's vision, ‘Fair to Customers, Fair to Bank’ is very true and can be seen in practice. The commitment and sincerity shown by  ICICI  Bank employees is really appreciated.Laxmi MalipatilThanks to my Relationship Manager for all the help in getting my loan disbursed. I still remember the day when I told him about the property in Mysore and I was little sceptical whether the loan would be processed or not. His approach to the case and knowledge is what impressed me. His prompt responses to all my messages, questions, and guidance in making me understand the calculations were very helpful.People like him are an asset to the organisation. All the best!!!Suraj KrishnadasThanks to my  RM  for helping me on my Mortgage Loan with the paperwork and closing it. I really liked her positive attitude and commitment to work",
