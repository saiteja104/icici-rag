While gold has always been an investment option, it is also effective for taking a loan in times of emergency. Keep reading this post to know why.Possessing gold has been looked upon as a mark of prosperity in Indian households since time immemorial. People in the country have emotional attachments to the gold jewellery they possess. Many people consider gold as collateral for taking a loan when faced with an emergency or sudden shortage of funds.Mentioned below are the reasons why you should consider taking agold loanto support your finances in the face of any emergency or urgent requirement of funds.1. Instant disbursal of fundsOne of the biggest advantages of the gold loan is you get instant funds whenever there is an emergency. The ICICI Bank Gold Loan disbursal is quick, and it is the best alternative to meet your financial needs, be it education, medical crisis, business expansion, or any other specific end-use.2. Lower Interest RatesThe first and the foremost advantage of gold loans are that these are secured loans. The lender holds your gold as collateral.3. Higher Loan AmountYou can borrow a significant amount of loan against your gold securities. ICICI Bank offers a loan maximum of up to Rs 2 crore against your gold jewellery. You can use theJewel Loan Eligibility Calculatorthat will give you the estimated eligible loan amount once you enter details such as loan tenure (in months), number of gold ornaments, the weight of the gold and carat details4. Flexible Repayment OptionsAmong all the secured loans, gold loans enjoy the most flexible repayment options. The borrower is generally allowed to choose from any one of the followingloan repayment options.Just pay at a shot at the end of the loan tenure.Pay a part of the principal amount and interest every month.Overdraft facility. Withdraw as and when the requirement arises. Interest will be charged only on the withdrawn amount. Pay principal at the end of the tenure and service the interest monthlyFlexi payment. Flexible repayment options without foreclosure charges.Every repayment option comes with its own financial implication. You are free to choose after assessing all the options.5. Lenient Eligibility CriteriaSince gold loans are relatively risk-free for the lenders, the eligibility criteria are very lenient.Anyone with gold ornaments can apply for a loan.The credit score of the borrower is not a major deciding factor.The income and employment status of the borrower is not accounted for.6. Faster, Safe, and Easy Processing of LoansGold loans do not have a complicated documentation process. You can just walk into the lender's office, submit KYC, get your gold evaluated, and you can walk out with an approved loan.If you want quicker processing of the gold loan, apply online through the lender's site and follow the instructions accordingly.It is high time to realize and unleash the value of your gold ornaments.

Once you are past your emergency, you can always go back and redeem your gold after paying back the loan amount.ICICI Bank offers instant Gold Loan at attractive interest rates.

Some common factors taken into consideration are:Ownership of Gold: You need to own gold jewellery, coins or ornaments that can be pledged as collateral for the Loan.Age: You need to be at least 18 years old to apply for a Gold Loan. Some lenders may have a higher minimum age requirement.Identification: You need to provide a valid proof of identity such as a Passport, Driving Licence or Aadhaar Card.Purity of Gold: The gold you pledge must meet the lender's purity standards.

This gives you the total value of your gold.Loan to Value Ratio: This is the percentage of the total value of the gold that the lender is willing to lend. It varies across lenders, but usually falls between 70% and 90%.Total Weight of Gold: This is the total weight of the gold you're pledging as collateral, usually measured in grams.Illustration:Suppose you have 50 grams of gold with a market rate of Rs 50 per gram. The total value of your gold will be Rs 50 x 50 = Rs 2,500. If the lender offers a Loan To Value ratio of 80%, the Loan amount per gram will be calculated as: 2,500 x 0.80 / 50 = Rs 40So, for every gram of gold you pledge, you will receive a Loan amount of Rs 40.T&Cs.View all FAQsView MoreGold loan Blogs5 Things You Should Know Before Getting a Gold Loan8 Months AgoShareCopyGold Loan Procedure: Step-by-Step from Application to Disbursal8 Months AgoShareCopyTop 5 Reasons to check your Loan amount with a Gold Loan Calculator8 Months AgoShareCopyWhat is Gold Loan and how does it work?8 Months AgoShareCopyTips to calculate Gold Loan eligibility before availing a Gold Loan8 Months AgoShareCopyView all blogs",

Please check back in a few minutes as an error has occurred.Gold - A unique metalGold is a unique metal. It is valued not just for its rarity, but also for its range of lovely colours, the distinctive character of its soft metallic glow, its resistance to tarnish, and its easy workability. Gold is so soft and malleable that one-ounce can be stretched into a wire 50 miles long, or hammered into a sheet so thin it covers 100 square feet.In its pure form, gold is a shiny yellow metal and is relatively inactive chemically. The chemical symbol for gold, Au, is derived from its Latin name, aurum. With a specific gravity of 19.4, it is also one of the heaviest of the common metals - more than twice as heavy as silver or lead. Because gold is chemically inert, it resists oxidation and other changes which diminish the brilliance of other metals.buy nowThe story of goldCountless ancient artifacts attest to gold's popularity and versatility. The most malleable and ductile of all metals, gold has invited the highest skills of artisans and craftsmen all through the ages. For thousands of years, gold has been formed into articles of ornamentation, into religious icons and talismans, and, of course, shaped and formed into currency.As a symbol of beauty, nobility and constancy, gold has been cherished and even worshiped. Wars have been fought and nations conquered for gold. It is because of its exceptionally high value that gold, in all its forms; from the very beginning has required accountability, a system of weights and a standardisation of purity. It is not surprising that the need to assay and account for gold led to the invention of the first scales and balances.The karat systemIn the karat system, pure gold is expressed as \"24 karats fine\" (24K). (Pure gold in commercial practice is 99.95 to fine, but is nominally considered 100%.) The gold content of any gold article depends on the proportion ofpure goldit contains.The most popular types that are used in jewellery in the United States are:24 K or 100% gold (99.95 %)18 K 18/24ths or 75% gold14 K 14/24ths or 58.33% gold10 K 10/24ths or 41.67% gold",
