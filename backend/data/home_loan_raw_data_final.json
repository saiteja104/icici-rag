Under such State Acts, in case of death of a society member, the society shall transfer the deceased member\u2019s share or interest to nominee(s). Based on the nomination certificate under the respective state acts, the Bank may return the title documents to the nominee(s).Handover of documents in cases where no nominee is registeredState Co-operative Societies Acts provide property owners with nomination facility. However, if the property is not situated in co-operative society or if the property is situated in co-operative society and the nominee is not registered, the following documents need to be collected from the claimant for handing over the original property documents after Loan closure.Documents required in case any of the property owners are missingAs per Section 108 of the Indian Evidence Act, presumption of death can be raised only after a lapse of 7 years from the date a person was reported missing, i.e. the date when the FIR/non-traceable report was lodged. Section 107 deals with presumption of continuance. As such, the nominees/legal heirs have to raise an express presumption of death of the borrower under Section 107/108 of the Indian Evidence Act before a competent court. If the court presumes that the borrower is dead, the claim of a missing person can be settled on the basis of the same.Handover of documents, where the deceased owner has left behind a WillIf the borrower has executed the Will, the title documents must be handed over to the executors as mentioned in the Will, after his/her death.Handover of documents where a person dies intestate (i.e. without a Will)When a person dies intestate i.e. without a Will, the original property documents can be handed over on the basis of documents mentioned in the table below that are taken from the legal heir/s in addition to the common documents.Mortgage Loan Conversion OptionsYou can reduce the existing rate of interest of your Mortgage Loan by availing our conversion option.

    "content": "Home Loans FAQs - All Housing Loans QueriesLoansHome LoanHome Loans FAQs - All Housing Loans QueriesHome Loans FAQsMoney Saver Home LoanEXPAND ALLWhat is Policy Repo Rate?\u201cRepo Rate\u201c or \u201cPolicy Repo Rate\u201d means the rate of interest published by RBI on the RBI website from time to time as Repo Rate or Policy Repo Rate.What is external benchmark rate of ICICI Bank Limited (\u201cICICI Bank\u201d) for floating interest rate Home/ Mortgage Loans?Currently, ICICI Bank benchmarks it\u2019s floating rate Home/ Mortgage Loans to Repo Rate.What does reset of floating rate loans linked to external benchmark mean?As per Master Direction - RBI (Interest Rate on Advances) Directions, 2016, floating rate loan means a loan on which interest rate does not remain fixed during the tenure of the loan. Hence, in case of floating interest rate loan, the benchmark rate of the loan gets revised on a pre-defined frequency. As per RBI guidelines, floating interest rate loans linked to external benchmark should reset at least once in three months.What will be the frequency of benchmark reset for floating rate Home/ Mortgage Loans?As per Master Direction - RBI (Interest Rate on Advances) Directions, 2016, the interest rate under external benchmark shall be reset at least once in months. Thus, the Repo Rate component of the Interest Rate will be reset on the first day of the third subsequent month from the month in which the Facility is first disbursed (irrespective of the date of disbursement) and every three months thereafter, as a sum of Repo Rate + \u201cSpread\u201d, plus applicable statutory levy, if any. The applicable Repo Rate shall be the rate prevailing one business day preceding the reset date.Illustration: For first disbursements made in the month of Oct 2019, the first reset date will be Jan 01, 2020 and thereafter on Apr 01, 2020 and so on.What will be the frequency of change in spread?As per Master Direction - RBI (Interest Rate on Advances) Directions, 2016, the spread of the facility may undergo change when borrower\u2019s credit assessment undergoes a substantial change, as agreed upon in the loan contract or the Bank could alter the spread once in three years. Thus, in case of any change in spread of the facility, the effective rate of interest may change.How will the benchmark reset impact the current Rate of Interest (ROI) in case the Repo rate increases or decreases?On the reset date, if the applicable Repo rate has increased, the effective ROI of the loan account will increase which in turn will impact the EMI/tenure of the loan. In case of decrease in Repo Rate, the ROI will decrease which in turn will impact the tenure of the loan.Illustration: Consider a scenario where first disbursement of the loan is done on Oct 15, 2019 under RBI Repo linked benchmark rate, with the RBI Repo Rate being 5.15% per annum (as on Oct 14, 2019) with a spread/margin of 400 basis points (bps). In such a case the effective rate would be 9.15% per annum.In the above scenario, the effective rate of 9.15% per annum would remain constant till the next reset date i.e. Jan 01, 2020.

    "content": "Home Loans FAQs - All Housing Loans QueriesLoansHome LoanHome Loans FAQs - All Housing Loans QueriesHome Loans FAQsMoney Saver Home LoanEXPAND ALLWhat is Policy Repo Rate?\u201cRepo Rate\u201c or \u201cPolicy Repo Rate\u201d means the rate of interest published by RBI on the RBI website from time to time as Repo Rate or Policy Repo Rate.What is external benchmark rate of ICICI Bank Limited (\u201cICICI Bank\u201d) for floating interest rate Home/ Mortgage Loans?Currently, ICICI Bank benchmarks it\u2019s floating rate Home/ Mortgage Loans to Repo Rate.What does reset of floating rate loans linked to external benchmark mean?As per Master Direction - RBI (Interest Rate on Advances) Directions, 2016, floating rate loan means a loan on which interest rate does not remain fixed during the tenure of the loan. Hence, in case of floating interest rate loan, the benchmark rate of the loan gets revised on a pre-defined frequency. As per RBI guidelines, floating interest rate loans linked to external benchmark should reset at least once in three months.What will be the frequency of benchmark reset for floating rate Home/ Mortgage Loans?As per Master Direction - RBI (Interest Rate on Advances) Directions, 2016, the interest rate under external benchmark shall be reset at least once in months. Thus, the Repo Rate component of the Interest Rate will be reset on the first day of the third subsequent month from the month in which the Facility is first disbursed (irrespective of the date of disbursement) and every three months thereafter, as a sum of Repo Rate + \u201cSpread\u201d, plus applicable statutory levy, if any. The applicable Repo Rate shall be the rate prevailing one business day preceding the reset date.Illustration: For first disbursements made in the month of Oct 2019, the first reset date will be Jan 01, 2020 and thereafter on Apr 01, 2020 and so on.What will be the frequency of change in spread?As per Master Direction - RBI (Interest Rate on Advances) Directions, 2016, the spread of the facility may undergo change when borrower\u2019s credit assessment undergoes a substantial change, as agreed upon in the loan contract or the Bank could alter the spread once in three years. Thus, in case of any change in spread of the facility, the effective rate of interest may change.How will the benchmark reset impact the current Rate of Interest (ROI) in case the Repo rate increases or decreases?On the reset date, if the applicable Repo rate has increased, the effective ROI of the loan account will increase which in turn will impact the EMI/tenure of the loan. In case of decrease in Repo Rate, the ROI will decrease which in turn will impact the tenure of the loan.Illustration: Consider a scenario where first disbursement of the loan is done on Oct 15, 2019 under RBI Repo linked benchmark rate, with the RBI Repo Rate being 5.15% per annum (as on Oct 14, 2019) with a spread/margin of 400 basis points (bps). In such a case the effective rate would be 9.15% per annum.In the above scenario, the effective rate of 9.15% per annum would remain constant till the next reset date i.e. Jan 01, 2020. On Jan 01, 2020, the loans would be reset with the applicable RBI Repo rate as on Dec 31, 2019.Will ICICI Bank discontinue the previous benchmark rates i.e. I-Base/FRR/PLR/MCLR?For all new floating rate Home/Mortgage Loans sanctioned from Oct 01, 2019, the Bank will only give loans linked to Repo Rate. However, the existing loans will continue on the respective PLR/FRR/I-Base/MCLR till its repayment.Will the existing loans booked under PLR/FRR/I-Base/MCLR get automatically reset under Repo linked benchmark rate?No, the existing loans will continue under the existing benchmark rate.Will the existing customers linked to FRR//PLR/I-Base/MCLR based benchmark rate be allowed to convert to Repo based pricing?Yes, all existing customers have an option to switch from the existing system of FRR/PLR/I-Base/MCLR (FRR/PLR/I-Base/MCLR +/- spread) to the new system of Repo linked rate (Repo + spread) at prevailing rate applicable for new loan with the same category of customer.Illustration: If an existing customer with a loan amount of Rs 2.5 million at 9.10% interest rate (I-MCLR-1Y (8.55%) + 0.55%) and if the customer opts to switch-over to Repo linked rate, then the applicable interest rate will be 8.90% per annum since the applicable ROI for new loan with the same category of customer is Repo rate (5.15%) + 3.50%.Will the existing customers linked to FRR//PLR/I-Base/MCLR need to pay switch/conversion fee to convert the loan to Repo linked pricing?Yes, customer will have to pay Switch/conversion fee. For details, the customer will be required to visit the nearest Asset Servicing Branch.What is the process for changing from an existing benchmark rate of FRR/PLR/I-Base/MCLR to Repo linked benchmark rate?For changing from existing benchmark rate of FRR/PLR/I-Base/MCLR to Repo based benchmark rate, the customer will be required to visit the nearest Asset Servicing Branch and submit the conversion request letter.Can I make a part pre-payment on my Home Loan Account through NEFT with ICICI Bank?Yes, ICICI Bank accepts part payment of yourhome loanthrough National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT).

Please check back in a few minutes as an error has occurred.Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana - Urban (PMAY-U) SchemePradhan Mantri Awas Yojana - Urban (PMAY-U) Scheme, a flagship programme was launched by The Honourable Prime Minister of India on June 25, 2015. The scheme aims to provide all-weather pucca1houses to eligible urban households, realising the vision of 'Housing for All'. As India's urban landscape expands, the demand for housing has grown exponentially. The need for affordable housing varies significantly across different income groups, including Economically Weaker Sections (EWS), Low-Income Groups (LIG) and Middle-Income Groups (MIG). To address this, the Government of India has introduced PMAY-U 2.0, which seeks to provide assistance to 1 crore eligible urban families over the next five years. PMAY-U 2.0 builds upon the learnings of its predecessor, incorporating global best practices and stakeholder feedback.The scheme comprises of four key verticals out of which ICICI Bank is participating in only the Interest Subsidy Scheme (ISS) which includes subsidy on Home Loans for EWS, LIG and MIG families, helping people to achieve their dream of owning a home.By providing affordable housing options, PMAY-U 2.0 aims to improve the quality of life for urban Indians, ensuring dignity and security for all.Interest Subsidy Scheme (ISS)The ISS is a Central Sector Scheme that aims to expand institutional credit flow to the affordable housing sector. Under this scheme, subsidies will be provided on Home Loans sanctioned and disbursed on or after September 1, 2024, to eligible beneficiaries of EWS, LIG and MIG for the purchase, re-purchase or construction of houses.Eligibility Criteria:Households belonging to EWS, LIG and MIG categories with an annual income of up to \u20b93 lakh, \u20b96 lakh and \u20b99 lakh respectively.Beneficiaries will be required to submit a self-attested certificate / affidavit as proof of income.Subsidy Details:A maximum interest subsidy of \u20b91.80 lakh, with a maximum Net Present Value (NPV) of \u20b91.50 lakh (at a discount rate of 8.5%), will be provided to eligible beneficiaries with a loan tenure of more than five years.For households with income up to \u20b99 lakh, a subsidy at 4% on the first \u20b98 lakh for a tenure up to 12 years will be provided.The carpet area of houses under this component should be up to 120 square meters.Subsidy Disbursement:The subsidy will be released to the beneficiaries in five equal yearly instalments.ParametersEWS/LIG/MIGAnnual HH2income (\u20b9)Up to \u20b99 lakhInterest Subsidy (% P.A.)4.00%Maximum Housing Loan eligible (\u20b9)\u20b925 lakhMaximum House Value (\u20b9)\u20b935 lakhMaximum Carpet area (up to) in sq. m.120Maximum benefit of interest subsidy (\u20b9)Actual Release \u20b91.80 lakhMaximum benefit of interest subsidy (\u20b9)NPV \u20b91.50 lakhLogin to the scheme hereExclusion (Ineligibility) Criteria under ISS:The subsidy under the scheme will be provided only once for a property. If it is sold to someone else, the purchaser can\u2019t take benefit of ISS on this property. Primary Lending Institutions (PLIs) are to ensure that subsidy benefit is not taken by the previous owner by checking on the unified web portal, before initiating the claim of the current occupantIf two or more family members take combined or separate loan on same property, they will be treated as same the family for calculation of family income and benefitIn case a borrower has taken a Housing Loan from one PLI and later switches to another PLI for balance transfer, such beneficiary will not be eligible to claim the benefit of interest subsidy again. If a person has not claimed interest subsidy from the first PLI, he / she shall not be eligible after balance transferOnly loan up to \u20b925 lakh with the house value up to \u20b935 lakh will be eligible for subsidy under this vertical. If the family income or property value as assessed by PLI for sanction of loan is higher than the eligibility limit, the loan will not be eligible for subsidyIn case of any false declaration on income level by a beneficiary who has already availed the scheme benefit, he / she would be liable for legal proceedings under applicable laws.Procedure:For availing the benefit under ISS vertical, eligible beneficiaries will be required to register their demand through unified web portal. Subsequently, the application will be forwarded to the concerned PLIs for further necessary action as per his / her eligibility criteria as per Annexure-7.Based on the loan disbursed by a PLI to beneficiaries, the Ministry shall release subsidy through single click on a monthly basis through Central Nodal Agency to PLI using unified web portal.
